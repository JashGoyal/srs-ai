    "Introduction": {
      "Purpose": "The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for a Task Management System that allows users to create, assign, track, and manage tasks efficiently.",
      "Scope": "The system will provide features like user authentication, task creation, assignment, prioritization, status tracking, notifications, and reporting. It will support both web and mobile interfaces.",

      {
        "Feature_Name": "Task Management",
        "Description": "Users can create, edit, assign, and delete tasks.",
        "Inputs": "Task title, description, due date, assignee, priority",
        "Processing": "Task stored and updated in the database",
        "Outputs": "Task details displayed in dashboard"
      },
      {
        "Feature_Name": "Reporting",
        "Description": "Generate reports of completed and pending tasks.",
        "Inputs": "Date range, filters (status, user, priority)",
        "Processing": "System queries database and processes statistics",
        "Outputs": "Report displayed as charts/tables"
      }
    ],
    "External_Interface_Requirements": {
      "User_Interfaces": "Responsive web interface (React) and mobile-friendly views.",
      "Hardware_Interfaces": "Standard client devices (PC, mobile). Server hosted on cloud.",

      "Communication_Interfaces": "HTTPS for client-server communication."
    },
    "Non_Functional_Requirements": {
      "Performance": "System should handle 1000 concurrent users with <2s response time.",
      "Security": "All passwords stored using hashing (bcrypt). JWT tokens for authentication. Data encrypted via TLS.",
      "Reliability": "System uptime should be 99.9%.",
      "Availability": "System should be available 24/7 except scheduled maintenance.",
      "Maintainability": "Codebase must follow modular design principles and be documented.",
      "Scalability": "System should scale horizontally to handle increasing users."
